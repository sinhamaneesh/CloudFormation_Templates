Hi, my name is marbot.

I'm a Slack bot supporting your DevOps team to detect and solve incidents on AWS.

I help you to set up AWS monitoring. There are countless possibilities on AWS. Overlooking the important settings is easy. I connect you with all relevant AWS sources. You never miss an incident again.

Donâ€™t get distracted from your deep work, when not absolutely necessary. I do send alerts to a single team member. Of course, I escalate unnoticed alerts to another team member or the whole crew if necessary.

Instead of cluttering up your inbox with emails I do send alerts via Slack. Just re-use your modern team communication solution. Invite me to multiple Slack channels to separate alerts. You can also talk to me.

I add links to AWS Management Console that are relevant to an incident. Contextual links save you time and reduce human error in stressful situations.
